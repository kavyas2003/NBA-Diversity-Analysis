                <h3>Zoom Out: NBA on a Global Scale</h3>
                <div>What about the players who are outsiders from foreign countries? 
                    Having explored a very interconnected NBA, what about those who aren't as connected? To the common fan, it may 
                    seem like there are a token few foreign players relative to the American which is true. But over the years there
                     have still been many in the league. Explore the level of global diversity in the league.</div>

                <h3> Does Nationality Play a Role in Draft Round?</h3>
                <div>After looking at the global distribution of NBA players, analyze if that has an influence on a player's value. What is a good metric
                     to gauge a players initial skill level and potential to play well? One option: Draft Number. 
                     Players with a lower draft number are the ones seeming to have a lot of potential. Does that always hold true 
                    throughout their careers? Not necessarily, but it is still relevant to how theyâ€™re seen and their start in the NBA. 
                    Taking into acount the previous sections, explore how the draft value of these players to the NBA and its teams 
                    may differ.</div>
